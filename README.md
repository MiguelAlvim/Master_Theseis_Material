# Master_Theseis_Material
Python 3 Code created by me during my master thesis research. Not very polished or explained, but fully functional.

In the ANN directory you'll find an implementation of a MADALINE artificial neural network in python 3. It uses the Rule 1 learning algorithm (MR1) with a OR output gate.

In the Data Set directory you'll find scripts that generate data sets with all possible student types in the Felder & Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) acording to the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) classification of Strong, Moderate and Balanced studend axes.

If you wish to use any of this, feel free.
