Python 3 Code created by me during my master thesis research. Not very polished or explained, but fully functional.

In the ANN directory you'll find an implementation of a MADALINE artificial neural network in python 3. It uses the Rule 1 learning algorithm (MR1) with a OR output gate.

In the Data Set directory you'll find scripts that generate data sets with all possible student types in the Felder & Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) acording to the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) classification of Strong, Moderate and Balanced studend axes.
You'll also find a script capable of creating all possible types of relevant learning objects in acordance to the method of mapping the IEEE-LOM to the FSLSM created by Anitha and Deisy (2015) 

If you wish to use any of this, feel free.

OBS:

For completude sake, here's the Anitha and Deisy work I'm refering to:
